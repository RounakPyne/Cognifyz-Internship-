## 📁 Repository Contents

### 1. **Cognifyz Data Analysis Internship Level 1**
   - **Description**: Initial data cleaning and handling of missing values.
   - **Key Insight**: 
     - Identified and addressed 9 missing values in the "cuisines" column (0.09% of the dataset).
     - These values were deleted due to their negligible proportion.


### 2. **Cognifyz Data Analysis Internship Level 2**
   - **Description**: Continued exploration with advanced cleaning techniques.
   - **Key Insight**:
     - Similar findings as Level 1, with additional focus on refining data cleaning approaches.
 

### 3. **Cognifyz Data Analysis Internship Level 3**
   - **Description**: Advanced data analysis and preparation for modeling or visualization.
   - **Key Insight**:
     - Consistent results as in prior levels, highlighting effective resolution of minimal missing data.
